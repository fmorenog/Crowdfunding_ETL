**# ETL mini project**

  **Description:**
  
      This project uses methods and functions and to list comprehensions to extract, transform, and clean data. Then, you'll pair with a partner to start working on the ETL mini project.
  
  **Challenge assignment:**
  
    This code pertains to a collaborative Project 02, which focuses on ETL and uses Python as a tool for the Extract and Transform part while uses SQL for the Load step.
    
  **Application:**
  
      One of the first uses for this code is to extract and clean data. It used Python and Pandas to extract and transform the data and subsequently create four different CSV files. Also, to design an ERD diagram to correlate all tables between primary and foreign keys.

  **Instructions to use:**
  
    To properly execute the code, follow these steps: First, run the .ipynd file to remove unnecessary information from the data source and give the remaining data a correct structure. Second, open the .sql file in Postgres and run it in parts to create each of the tables. The next step is to import each of the CSV files into their respective tables. Finally, run the queries one by one.
